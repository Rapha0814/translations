However, we are able to counter this mass spying using cryptography but too few projects allow us to protect us properly. But today, we are fortunate to have a safe alternative for our mails: <span>ProtonMail</span>, which allows encryption end-to-end thereof. Also, you can use <span>Ring.cx</span> or <span>Tox.chat</span> to encrypt your conversations.<br>It's in this perspective that we launched the development of <span>Muonium</span>, to offer an alternative for storing securely your documents online.
