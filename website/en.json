For many years, private companies such as Google, Facebook, etc... as well as government agencies spy on us to gather informations about us everyday on the web. However, we are able to counter this mass spying using cryptography but not enough projects allow us to protect ourselves properly. But today, we are fortunate to have a safe alternative for our email: <span>ProtonMail</span>, which allows end-to-end encryption. Also, you can use <span>Ring.cx</span> or <span>Tox.chat</span> to encrypt your conversations.<br>It's in this perspective that we launched the development of <span>Muonium</span>, to offer an alternative for storing your documents online securely. Our policy requires us to end-to-end encrypt files making you the only true owner of your files.",

The encryption algorithm used is <b>AES</b> with <a href='http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/'>SJCL</a> (which is a complete and open source implementation of AES) which allows a <b>256 bits encryption (equivalent of more RSA 2048)</b>. When creating an account, the user defines one personal passphrase (it's a password) in order to encrypt and decrypt his files. With this principle, we can't decrypt your files.

Once you're logged in, you need to enter <b>your passphrase</b> to be able to decrypt your key, then allows the decryption of your files, this corresponds to the second layer. But we thought that an additional layer provides more security. After your passphrase, <b>an email with a code will be sent</b>, you need to enter the received code on the page to be totally logged. All this may be a little while, but it strengthens the security of your account.<br>This system is inspired by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication'>double-authentication</a> made by some sites like Google or Facebook."
